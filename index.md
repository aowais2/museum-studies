This project focuses on acquiring a better understanding of visitor behaviour patterns in exhibitions through museum settings. The amount of time spent at each display by a visitor and the way visitors interact with each display and its corresponding display/s plays a vital role in curation-related decision making. Further, as Museums move towards digitizing various aspects of the museum experience, we are interested in understanding if digitization, specifically of Museum labels, has a more positive impact on a visitor's museum experience. Using technological solutions, we aim at designing methodologies that enable us with privacy-aware monitoring of visitor movement patterns through museum rooms. This then allows us to determine how much time each participant spends at each display/room. It is important to note that the solutions used in this project don't use face recognition and don't store identifiers relating to visitors in any databases.
