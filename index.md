### Study Description

This project focuses on acquiring a better understanding of visitor behaviour patterns in exhibitions through museum settings. The amount of time spent at each display by a visitor and the way visitors interact with each display and its corresponding display/s plays a vital role in curation-related decision making. Further, as Museums move towards digitizing various aspects of the museum experience, we are interested in understanding if digitization, specifically of Museum labels, has a more positive impact on a visitor's museum experience. Using technological solutions, we aim at designing methodologies that enable us with privacy-aware monitoring of visitor movement patterns through museum rooms. This then allows us to determine how much time each participant spends at each display/room. 

It is important to note that the solutions used in this project don't use face recognition and don't store identifiers relating to visitors in any databases. This study was reviewed under strict ethical guidelines by the University of Waterloo Office of Research Ethics, ORE # 43272.
