### Study Description

This project focuses on acquiring a better understanding of visitor behaviour patterns in exhibitions through museum settings. The amount of time spent at each display by a visitor and the way visitors interact with each display and its corresponding display/s plays a vital role in curation-related decision making. Further, as Museums move towards digitizing various aspects of the museum experience, we are interested in understanding if digitization, specifically of Museum labels, has a more positive impact on a visitor's museum experience. Using technological solutions, we aim at designing methodologies that enable us with privacy-aware monitoring of visitor movement patterns through museum rooms. This then allows us to determine how much time each participant spends at each display/room. 

It is important to note that the solutions used in this project don't use face recognition and don't store identifiers relating to visitors in any databases. This study was reviewed under strict ethical guidelines by the University of Waterloo Office of Research Ethics, ORE # 43272. If you have any concerns that you would like to address to the Office of Research Ethics, please contact ResearchOffice@uwaterloo.ca

### Thank you to the participants

Thank you for participating in this experiment. The collected data will contribute to a better understanding of the appropriate direction of future development in the museum studies.


All captured data will be de-identified and stored on a secure password-protected lab server with access only to the researchers. Once all the data is analyzed for this project, we plan on sharing general statistical information with the research community through seminars, conferences, presentations, and journal articles. If you are interested in receiving more information regarding the results of this study, or would like a summary of the results, please contact us at omabdulh@uwaterloo.ca, and when the study is completed, anticipated by the end of summer 2022, we will send you the information. In the meantime, if you have any questions about the study, please do not hesitate to contact us by email.

This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee (ORE#43272). If you have questions for the Committee contact the Office of Research Ethics, at 1-519-888-4567 ext. 36005 or ore-ceo@uwaterloo.ca. For all other questions contact us by email at omabdulh@uwaterloo.ca

### Overview

Researchers at the University of Waterloo have partnered with the Museum to gain a better understanding of visitor behaviour patterns in exhibitions through museum settings. In particular, this study aims to analyze the following aspects of museum visitor interactions:
1. What is the progression of visitors through the exhibition?
2. How much time do visitors spend interacting with a museum display on average?
3. What are the effects of using different types of museum labels (digital, paper based etc.) at each display regarding visitor engagement with that specific display?
The amount of time spent at each display by a visitor and the way visitors interact with each display plays a vital role in curation-related decision making. Further, as Museums move towards digitizing various aspects of the museum experience, we are interested in understanding if digitization, specifically of the museum labels, has a more positive impact on a visitor's museum experience.To help us achieve our objectives, the Rolling Stones exhibit will be monitored through the use of a camera which will be placed high up to get a bird’s eye view of the room. This camera uses privacy aware software to collect statistical information about the movement patterns of museum visitors in the room. In other words, no identifying information will be collected about museum visitors. Observing the patterns allows us to determine how much time each visitor spends at each display. This then helps us to provide feedback to the Museum regarding how popular certain exhibits are.

### What does participation involve? 
Participation in this study is assumed when the participants enter the  space with signage. The participants do not need to do anything  specific, we wish to simply observe as they move across the space.

### Your rights as a participant

Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may decline to  participate by coming back at any point other than the time periods  specified. For the sake of clarity, these times are 11 AM to 2 PM,  Tuesdays and Thursdays only. No recording is conducted at any other  time. You may decide to stop any time and leave the hall if you feel  uncomfortable. 

Benefits of the study: Participation in this study will not provide any direct benefit to you, however study results will be used to better understand museum visitors' movement patterns through an exhibit. This is important for assisting museum management with estimating viewership patterns and the popularity of specific exhibits. There are no known or anticipated risks associated with participation in this study.
Confidentiality: As noted above, no identifying information about museum visitors will be collected during this study. The camera will not store images of participants’ faces or bodies. Rather, the software used by the research team will detect the area in which a person was standing or moving in. This information will be translated into coordinates that will make up the dataset to be analyzed by the research team. Collected data will be securely stored for a minimum of 7 years on a password-protected lab server accessible only to members of the research team. Because data is anonymized, please note that it will not be possible to withdraw data once it is collected. The anonymized data may be shared publicly (e.g., in data repositories). Sharing the data allows other researchers to verify results and avoid duplicating research.
